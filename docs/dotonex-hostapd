dotonex (hostapd interaction)
===

A dotonex instance generally interacts with hostapd through two formats. See
also `hostapd`.

# proxy

A proxy instance of dotonex will be used to pass user authentications that pass
pre-auth checks to hostapd

# composition

The composition element of dotonex manages the underying hostapd "eap_user" file
which defines MAB and user logins that are allowed. This element is also responsible
for indicating to hostapd that it needs to reload the file.

## daemon

The `dotonex-daemon` will perform auto setup and configuration of the underlying
certificates for hostapd. It also maintains responsibility for making sure a hostapd
instance if up and running.
