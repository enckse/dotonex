dotonex-daemon
===

The `dotonex-daemon` is a shell script wrapper that invokes `dotonex` itself. It,
additionally, invokes an instance of `hostapd` for dotonex to connect to.

# env

The daemon itself will source the `env` file found within `/etc/dotonex/` which contains
the source repository to clone (for dynamic configuration setups via `dotonex-compose`),
the build version information, and the certificate key to use when generating certificates
for hostapd during first-run.

# setup

During first-run the daemon will necessarily attempt to clone (if a clone does not exist)
the server repository (if the server repository is non-empty). It will also attempt to
generate certificates and set the certificate key dynamically for all `hostapd` configuration
files

# running

Once setup is completed then the daemon will simply loop and attempt to restart `hostapd`
or `dotonex` if either process fails.
