dotonex-runner
===

The dotonex-runner is generally invoked by `dotonex` from a detected configuration
file as a single instance (e.g. accounting or proxy). The runner itself is responsible
for performing accounting or pre-auth checking and then proxying to `hostapd` for final
user validation.

# proxy

When operating as a proxy the `dotonex-runner` will attempt to perform pre-auth validation
and then pass the packet on for further processing as required. The packet will be read and the "User-Name" attribute will be interrogate. If the "User-Name"
is available it will be passed to a pre-auth step which will validate the user name and MAC
address are valid (see `dotonex-compose` and `dotonex.compose.conf` for more information).
If the user name and MAC are valid (or a MAB situation is detected) than the proxy will pass
the packet to `hostapd` to validate the credentials for the request (performing any EAP
transactions).

# accounting

An accounting instance provides a simplistic writing of accounting information to disk.

# composition

Any proxy instance of a `dotonex-runner` will utilize the `dotonex.compose.conf` section
of the configuration to assist in maintaining a background dynamic composition of user
configurations.
