dotonex
===

The `dotonex` executable itself has few responsiblities. The sole purpose of this
application is to find and detect configurations files within `/etc/dotonex` at the
root level that are valid and start instances for each configuration that is found.

When one of the instances recycles (or fails) the `dotonex` application will
attempt to restart the instance (with some cooldowns to allow for debugging
and recovery attempts).
